> a GitHub App built with [probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that enforces the format of PR titles/commits

## Overview

The purpose of this bot is to reject PRs with titles that do not conform to format described in https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/

In summary, a PR should be titled such that the sentence "If applied, this commit will \$PR_TITLE" makes sense.

## Setup

```
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```

See [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md) if you would like to run your own instance of this app.
